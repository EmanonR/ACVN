Ascii Console Visual Novel Engine

Engine.cs is the game engine, this could be edited but is not meant for game logic
Script.cs is for game logic, make the game inside here.
Program.cs tbh this just launches the game, im new to this shit

Characters.txt is used for sprites, such as characters, a single ":" sepperated frames as per example
Backgrounds.txt is used for backgrounds, they tile and cut off when they dont fit
